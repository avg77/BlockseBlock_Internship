### Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Work is a system where miners in a network solve mathematical puzzles to add a block to the blockchain.
- They use highly computational computers to find a number called 'nonce' that fits specific rules for the block’s hash.
- This takes a lot of energy because the computers do millions of calculations and need power to run and cool.
- The high energy cost makes the network secure by making it hard and almost impossible to hack or modify blockchain state.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Proof of Stake chooses people who own coins (stakers) to create new blocks based on their coin holdings and staked collateral.
- Stakers lock their coins and the system picks them randomly or by stake size to validate transactions.
- Unlike PoW, it doesn’t need heavy calculations, so it uses much less energy.
- This makes PoS faster, more efficient, and less energy-intensive than PoW.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Delegated Proof of Stake lets coin holders vote for a small group of “delegates” to validate transactions.
- These delegates, or validators, are chosen based on the votes they get.
- It’s faster than PoS because fewer people validate, making the process more efficient.
- However, it’s less decentralized since only the elected delegates control the network.
